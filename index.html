<pre>
Like to the falling of a star,
Or as the flights of eagles are,
Or like the fresh spring’s gaudy hue,
Or silver drops of morning dew.

Or like the wind that chafes the flood,
Or bubbles which on water stood;
Even such is Man, whose borrowed light
Is straight called in and paid to night.

The winds blow out; the bubble dies;
The spring entombed in autumn lies;
The dew’s dryed up;
the star is shot;
The flight is past;
and man
forgot...
